    <p>A bike can refer to a bicycle or a motorcycle, both two-wheeled vehicles with distinct purposes, designs, and operating methods. The type of "bike" a person chooses depends on their goals, whether it's for commuting, exercise, adventure, or sport. Bicycles are human-powered vehicles used for recreation, sport, and short-distance transportation, offering a healthier and more eco-friendly option. Common types include mountain bikes for off-road riding, lightweight road bikes for paved surfaces, and versatile hybrid bikes that combine features of both. For urban life, folding bikes are convenient for transport and storage, while electric bikes provide a motor-assisted boost. In contrast, motorcycles are motor vehicles with an engine, offering speed and performance for commuting and long-distance travel. The anatomy of a motorcycle includes the engine, which determines power; the chassis, which provides the skeletal frame; and the controls, which are operated by both hands and feet. The wheels and tires are crucial for performance and safety, while the dashboard displays essential information.</p>
